    "# API Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we summarize the main objects within the `pysersic` framework and how they are most commonly used, along with summaries of their public methods and attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more \"step by step\" guide to fitting a galaxy image, see the fititng tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pysersic.priors \n",
    "\n",
    "### BasePrior(ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BasePrior` object is responsible for the initial instantiation of any prior used by `pysersic`. Its main job is setting sky prior values. You *should not* have to interface directly with this class, unless you are trying to make your own `Prior` subclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "- `sky_guess`: central value of the sky pixel distributio \n",
    "- `sky_guess_err`: estimate of the scatter around `sky_guess`\n",
    "- `sky_type`: selected form of sky to fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "- `sample_sky_none()`: method called when not sampling the sky (returns 0).\n",
    "- `sample_sky_flat()`: method called when sampling a flat sky. \n",
    "- `sample_sky_tilted_plane()` method called when sampling a tilted plane sky. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PySersicSourcePrior(BasePrior)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PysersicSourcePrior` inherits sky properties from the `BasePrior` and adds the relevant information needed to sample galaxy properties. This class is used directly when fitting a single galaxy in an image, and is wrapped by the class (below) which handles multi-source images. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `profile_type`: type of profile chosen to fit (e.g., \"sersic\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__repr__()` The repr of this object prints out all of the parameters being fit and what their priors are. \n",
    "- `set_gaussian_prior(var_name,loc,scale)`: set a gaussian prior on one of the fit parameters, giving a loc and scale. \n",
    "- `set_uniform_prior(var-name, low, high)`: set a uniform prior on one of the fit parameters, giving a low and high value. \n",
    "- `set_truncated_gaussian_prior(var_name,loc,scale,low,high)`: set a truncated gaussian prior, giving the loc/scale of the gaussian and the low/high beyond which the distribution is truncated\n",
    "- `set_custom_prior(var_name,prior_dist)`: Set a totally custom prior, giving a `numpyro.dist.Distribution` object, and optionally an `infer.reparam.Reparam` reparametrization as needed. \n",
    "- `check_vars(verbose=False)`: checks whether all variables for the profile type selected are set. If `verbose=True`, will print any missing variables and any extra variables. Will return true if all variables for the type are given with no extras. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PySersicMultiPrior(BasePrior)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PySersicMultiPrior` wraps the single prior object and sets up all the priors for multiple sources in one image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike for the single prior case, `PySersicMultiPrior` utilizes an input catalog to set the locations and priors for sources in the image. This catalog can be input in multiple formats so long as they are key-able, e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`, `dict`, or `numpy.recordarray()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you instantiate a `PySersicMultiPrior` object, provide the `catalog`, along with the sky type to fit, and a sky guess and sky guess error: \n",
    "```\n",
    "prior = PySersicMultiPrior(catalog,sky_type='flat',sky_guess=XXX,sky_guess_err=XXX)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The catalog has several required keys/columns: \n",
    "- `x`: pixel x position of source \n",
    "- `y`: pixel y position of source \n",
    "- `r`: estimate of effective radius in pixels \n",
    "- `flux`: estimate of the total source flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, a column can be provided for theta:\n",
    "- `theta:`: position angle of source, in radians. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SourceProperties() \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SourceProperties` class reads in an input image and derives properties relevant to the setting of prior parameters for fitting. When fitting a single source (and masking others), this class can be used to automatically set the priors before fitting. When fitting multiple sources in one image, a catalog is needed, but this class can still be used to generate estimates of the sky to feed into `PySersicMultiPrior`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up simply involves providing an image and/or mask:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sp = SourceProperties(image=image,mask=mask)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The class automatically measures the properties of the source in the image. You can visualize the measurements via the `.visualize()` method, which will show your image with a circle at the measured r-eff value, an x at the center position, and an arrow showing the measured theta. It won't show the flux guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the measurement (which uses `astropy`'s `data_properties` function) is off for some reason, you can set/overwrite any of the guesses via the methods (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cat`: the `astropy` `data_properties` catalog output, used to generate guesses. \n",
    "- `sky_guess`: the measured sky value. By default, a ring of pixels at the edge of the image, median value. \n",
    "- `sky_guess_err`: standard deviation of the ring of pixels around the image perimeter. \n",
    "- `flux_guess`: estimate of the source flux using `segment_flux` from the `astropy` catalog. If the flux guess is less than 0, it is set to 0. \n",
    "- `flux_guess_err`: if flux estimate > 0, is by default `2 * sqrt(flux_guess)`, if flux estimate is < 0, will be the `sqrt(abs(flux guess))`. \n",
    "- `r_eff_guess`: estimate of r-effective, taken to be the `kron radius` from the `astropy` catalog. \n",
    "- `r_eff_guess_err`: taken to be `sqrt(r_eff_guess)`. \n",
    "- `theta_guess`: estimate of position angle from catalog. \n",
    "- `position_guess`: estimate of the x,y position of the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The main setters are used to set the value of the guesses needed to generate a prior. They are run (once) automatically, setting their relative attributes (above) based on image measurements. You can run them again if you have a better value than the defaults measured. Note that even if the guesses are somewhat off, the fit should still proceed normally. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `set_sky_guess(sky_guess,sky_guess_err,n_pix_sample)`: set/overwrite/measure the sky,setting the relevant sky attributes. Running with guesses set to `None`, it will measure the perimeter of the image, taking the median of the first `n_pix_sample` rows and columns. It uses the masked image if a masked image was provided at instantiation. \n",
    "- `set_flux_guess(flux_guess,flux_guess_err)`: set/overwrite the flux and flux err guesses with a custom value. \n",
    "- `set_r_eff_guess(r_eff_guess,r_eff_guess_err)`: set/overwrite the measured guess/guess err for r-effective. \n",
    "- `set_theta_guess(theta_guess)`: set/overwrite the guess for theta. \n",
    "- `set_position_guess(position_guess)`: provide a tuple/list [x,y] of the position of the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the methods, beyond the parameter setters:\n",
    "- `generate_prior(profile_type,sky_type)`: This takes all the properties that have been measured or set and returns the `PySersicPrior` object instantiated using those values. The `profile_type` is one of `sersic`, `doublesersic`, `pointsource`, `dev`, or `exp`. \n",
    "- `visualize(figsize,cmap,scale)`: Allows one to quickly visualize the measured/set guesses over the data. All args are optional, but figsize, cmap, and an image scaling can be set. "
